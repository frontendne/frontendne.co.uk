Frontend NE is a free evening meetup, dedicated to all aspects of front-end development.

We aim to cover a wide variety of topics around the technology, tools, processes, and experiences of front-end development, with thought-provoking talks from a variety of speakers.

We're still sorting out the details at the moment. But if you sign up to our newsletter below, we'll let you know when we're ready.
