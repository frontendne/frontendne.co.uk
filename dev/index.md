Frontend NE is a free, monthly meet up about frontend development, based in Newcastle.


With great talks from some of the best developers in the North East, and the usual trip to the local pub to wash it all down afterwards; it's always a good night. So come along, the pizzas and beers are on us!

Weâ€™re sorting out all the bits and bobs for our first meet up right now; sign up to our mailing list, and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/frontendne) to stay in the loop.
