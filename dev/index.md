Frontend NE is a free, monthly meet up about frontend development, based in Newcastle.

With great talks from some of the best developers in the North East, and the usual trip to the local pub to wash it all down afterwards; it's always a good night. So come along, the pizzas and beers are on us!

We meet at [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/#contact) on the first Thursday of each month (starting in April). If you'd like to talk at Frontend NE, please submit a proposal to our [call for speakers](https://frontendne.typeform.com/to/BgAKni).
