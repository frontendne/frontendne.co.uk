Frontend NE is a free, monthly meetup about front-end development; based in Newcastle.

With great talks from some of the best developers in the North-East, and the usual trip to the local pub to wash it all down afterwards. It’s always a good night. So come along, the pizzas and beer are on us.

We’re sorting out all the bits and bobs right now. Sign up to our mailing list, and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/frontendne) to stay in the loop.
