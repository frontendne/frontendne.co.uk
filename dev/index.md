## About Us
Frontend NE is a free, monthly meet up about frontend development, based in Newcastle.

With great talks from some of the best developers in the North East, and the usual trip to the local pub to wash it all down afterwards; it's always a good night.
So come along, the pizzas and beers are on us!

We meet at [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/#contact) on the first Thursday of each month.
You can follow us on [Twitter](//twitter.com/frontendne), track us on [Lanyard](//lanyrd.com/2015/frontendne/) or take a peek at [our favourite gif](/our-favourite.gif).

## Call for Speakers
We're always on the lookout for new speakers.
It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned veteran or a complete newbie.
If you have something you feel passionate about, we want to hear from you.
Need a little help getting started? [We have you covered](http://weareallaweso.me/).

As far as topics go, as long as it's related to frontend, we're happy.
Anything from design tips, to CSS tricks, to Javascript frameworks.
Talks are 20 minutes with a short Q&A afterwards, so keep it brief and on-point. 

If you'd like to talk at Frontend NE, please submit a proposal to our [call for speakers](https://frontendne.typeform.com/to/BgAKni).

## Location
The lovely folks at Campus north have let us use their space for our event.
It's between Body Zone fitness and World Headquarters.
You can see exactly where it is on our [map](#map).

We'll be in the back room, but there'll be someone in the main space that can direct you to the right place.

After the event we head off to [the ware rooms](http://www.thewarerooms.co.uk) for some pool, beers, and a chance to discuss the event.
If you can't make it to the event you're more than welcome to join us in the pub afterwards. We should be there from about 8pm.
