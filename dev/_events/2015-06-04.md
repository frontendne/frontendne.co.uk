title: CSS Selector Bonanza!
---
I hope you all enjoyed our brief foray into Javascript MVC frameworks last month, but it's back to our roots with CSS!

Libby Gardener and Richard Carter will be taking us on a journey of all the weird and wonderful CSS selectors.
Ever wondered how to use `nth-child`, or been baffled by a selector that could only be described as ASCII art?
This is the one for you.

As usual, our beer and pizza quota will be filled by [Peacock Carter](http://www.peacockcarter.co.uk/) and [Hurst Dev](http://www.hurstdev.co.uk/) respectively.
Get yourself down and get some learning in yer!

Tickets go on sale here at 11am on the 28th of May.
