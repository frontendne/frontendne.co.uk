We're deviating from our usual plan to bring you something a little bit special this month.

## Remember, remember üî•


Remember, remember, the 5th of November. It's bonfire night, Sam's mum's birthday, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äî[the next Frontend NE event!](http://frontendne.co.uk/).

There will be no talks, no speakers, and no pizza. Just kidding üòú, we totally still have pizza. We will however be replacing the usual two-talk format with a **panel**. We've invited three guys‚Äîwho really know their stuff‚Äîto come along and answer your questions.

## The Panel

First up we have net awards' [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/previous-winners/), [Dan Edwards](http://twitter.com/de). He's a co-founder of both [No Divide](http://nodividestudio.com/) and [Oozled](http://oozled.com/). You may have seen him speaking a a conference or two. He's also the host of [#](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsThXCNzMKRZkIcNqxba_WSLfY5VsxIhz)[letstalkdesign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmLos6SO6-4&list=PLsThXCNzMKRZkIcNqxba_WSLfY5VsxIhz&index=5) where we totally got this panel/Q&A¬†idea from. Got a question on design? Dan's the man.

Joining Dan is his partner in crime, [Ryan Taylor](https://twitter.com/ryanhavoc). He also co-founded [No Divide](http://nodividestudio.com/) and [Oozled](http://oozled.com/) and is a big contributor to net Magazine. He's recently written a book for Five Simple Steps, '[Version Control with Git](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/version-control-with-git)' which I'd highly recommend. You can see Dan and Ryan on the special episode of [#letstalkdesign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmLos6SO6-4&list=PLsThXCNzMKRZkIcNqxba_WSLfY5VsxIhz&index=5). Want to know what it's like running a remote agency? Ask Ryan.

We also have the North East's very own, [Richard Powell](https://twitter.com/byrichardpowell). Richard is in charge of the product UI at [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), a HUGE Backbone & React application. He's also a proficient speaker and giver of workshops on pretty much anything Javascript. I've been to one of his Backbone workshops before, and this guy knows his stuff. If your interested in Javascript, direct your questions to Richard.
