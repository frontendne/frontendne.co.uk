title: Become a better team player
---

This month we're moving away from technical talks and looking at how you can become a better team player. A big part of our jobs is working with designers and back end developers. So we've invited two talented people from their respective fields to talk about working together.


[Ben Holliday](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday)  will be picking up the design side of the evening. He's the head of UX at the Department of working pensions.

Covering the back-end (wheeey!) is Frontend NE regular [Jamie Hurst](https://twitter.com/JamieFDHurst). Jamie is the owner of Hurst Dev and has a great deal of respect for Frontend developers.

All 50 tickets will be made available here at 11am on the <strong>27th of August.</strong>

If enough people join the waiting list after this initial allocation, we'll open up the big room.

###Sponsors

[Bede Gaming](http://www.bedegaming.com/) will be sponsoring pizzas again this month, form Herb Garden and  [Peacock Carter](http://www.peacockcarter.co.uk/) will be providing the usual ales, lagers and beers for you all with Campus North housing us all for the night.

The usual 15% discount at the Ware rooms still stands.
