title: Web components and ES6
---

This month we're learning about the future. It's a pretty javascript-heavy event again as we talk about PolymerJS, web components and the next version of the Javascript standard, ES6.

First up, Frontend NE’s very own  [Sam Beckham](https://twitter.com/samdbeckham) will take us through using Polymer and joining the web components revolution! This will be a sneak-peek of his talk for [UpFront Mini](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/events/upfront-mini) the following week.

Then it’s over to [Steve Higgs](https://twitter.com/shiggsatwork) from Opentable. He’ll cover the great new features ES6 brings and why it will redefine the way we write JavaScript. Browser support is pretty thin at the moment so Steve will explain how to use ES6 today!


###Tickets

As ever, tickets go on sale a week before the event. That’s **Thursday the 24th of September**. People seemed to miss the staggered launch, so we're bringing it back! The first batch of tickets will go out at **11am** and the second batch at **1pm**. Get those alarms set.

###Sponsors

There'll be plenty of pizza and beer supplied by [Bede Gaming](http://www.bedegaming.com/) and [Peacock Carter](http://www.peacockcarter.co.uk/) before and during the talks. Then it's round the corner to [The Ware Rooms](http://www.thewarerooms.co.uk) to for more frontend chat and 15% off at the bar.


###Share your expertise

We’re always on the lookout for speakers; whether it’s hardcore Javascript, CSS, war stories, or even front-end lifestyle. Background, experience, and shoe-size don't matter. If you've got a good idea for a talk, we want to hear from you.


Head over and [submit your talk](https://frontendne.typeform.com/to/BgAKni) and we’ll be in touch.
