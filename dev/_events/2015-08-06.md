Javascript MVCs are back in the Frontend NE spotlight this month as we look at Facebook and Google's offerings.

[Damian Nicholson](https://twitter.com/damian) will be introducing us to Angular JS. Written and maintained by the engineers at Google, Angular is by far the most popular Javascript MVC. Despite its popularity, it's not without its flaws.

[Jonathan Hamilton](https://twitter.com/jonnyfromnothin) is going to talk us through us how and why he moved from Angular to React.js. React is the new kid on the block, developed by the Facebook engineers. It's rapidly growing in popularity and is a strong contender for Angular's throne.

Tickets will be made available here at 11am on the <strong>30th of July.</strong>

All fifty will be up for grabs at 11am, so set those reminders. If you miss out, add your name to the waiting list and get first dibs if any extra tickets are released!
