title: Task runners are awesome!
---

It was only a matter of time before we covered task runners. They're an integral part of our workflow here at Frontend NE and they truly are awesome.

[Jonathan Steele](https://twitter.com/ynnoj) is stepping up to the plate first with a basic overview of how a task runner can help you and what's out there in task runner land. He'll touch on the three biggest task runners: Grunt, Gulp, and the lesser-known Broccoli.

After the break, [Alex Newman](https://twitter.com/alexnewmn) will take us through his Gulp workflow:

+ What made him decide on Gulp?
+ How does he use it?
+ Why do I feel the need to add a third question?

Find out the answer to the first two questions on July 2nd.

There's a slight change in the line-up as [Bede Gaming](http://www.bedegaming.com/) step up to sponsor pizzas this month. Don't worry, they know what we like, the pizzas are still straight from the Herb Garden. [Peacock Carter](http://www.peacockcarter.co.uk/) will be providing the usual ales, lagers and beers for you all with Campus North housing us all for the night. Oh, and the usual 15% discount at the Ware rooms still stands.

It should be a good one, we hope to see you all there!
