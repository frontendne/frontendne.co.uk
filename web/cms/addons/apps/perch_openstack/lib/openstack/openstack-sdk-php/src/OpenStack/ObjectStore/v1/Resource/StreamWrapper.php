/**
 * Provides stream wrapping for Swift.
 *
 * This provides a full stream wrapper to expose `swift://` URLs to the
 * PHP stream system.
 *
 * Swift streams provide authenticated and priviledged access to the
 * swift data store. These URLs are not generally used for granting
 * unauthenticated access to files (which can be done using the HTTP
 * stream wrapper -- no need for swift-specific logic).
 *
 * URL Structure
 *
 * This takes URLs of the following form:
 *
 * `swift://CONTAINER/FILE`
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * `swift://public/example.txt`
 *
 * The example above would access the `public` container and attempt to
 * retrieve the file named `example.txt`.
 *
 * Slashes are legal in Swift filenames, so a pathlike URL can be constructed
 * like this:
 *
 * `swift://public/path/like/file/name.txt`
 *
 * The above would attempt to find a file in object storage named
 * `path/like/file/name.txt`.
 *
 * A note on UTF-8 and URLs: PHP does not yet natively support many UTF-8
 * characters in URLs. Thus, you ought to rawurlencode() your container name
 * and object name (path) if there is any possibility that it will contain
 * UTF-8 characters.
 *
 * Locking
 *
 * This library does not support locking (e.g. flock()). This is because the
 * OpenStack Object Storage implementation does not support locking. But there
 * are a few related things you should keep in mind:
 *
 * - Working with a stream is essentially working with a COPY OF a remote file.
 *   Local locking is not an issue.
 * - If you open two streams for the same object, you will be working with
 *   TWO COPIES of the object. This can, of course, lead to nasty race
 *   conditions if each copy is modified.
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * The principle purpose of this wrapper is to make it easy to access and
 * manipulate objects on a remote object storage instance. Managing
 * containers is a secondary concern (and can often better be managed using
 * the OpenStack API). Consequently, almost all actions done through the
 * stream wrapper are focused on objects, not containers, servers, etc.
 *
 * Retrieving an Existing Object
 *
 * Retrieving an object is done by opening a file handle to that object.
 *
 * Writing an Object
 *
 * Nothing is written to the remote storage until the file is closed. This
 * keeps network traffic at a minimum, and respects the more-or-less stateless
 * nature of ObjectStorage.
 *
 * USING FILE/STREAM RESOURCES
 *
 * In general, you should access files like this:
 *
 *     <?php
 *     \OpenStack\Bootstrap::useStreamWrappers();
 *     // Set up the context.
 *     $context = stream_context_create(
 *       array('swift' => array(
 *         'username' => USERNAME,
 *         'password' => PASSWORD,
 *         'tenantid' => TENANT_ID,
 *         'tenantname' => TENANT_NAME, // Optional instead of tenantid.
 *         'endpoint' => AUTH_ENDPOINT_URL,
 *       )
 *      )
 *     );
 *     // Open the file.
 *     $handle = fopen('swift://mycontainer/myobject.txt', 'r+', false, $context);
 *
 *     // You can get the entire file, or use fread() to loop through the file.
 *     $contents = stream_get_contents($handle);
 *
 *     fclose($handle);
 *     ?>
 *
 * Remarks
 * - file_get_contents() works fine.
 * - You can write to a stream, too. Nothing is pushed to the server until
 *   fflush() or fclose() is called.
 * - Mode strings (w, r, w+, r+, c, c+, a, a+, x, x+) all work, though certain
 *   constraints are slightly relaxed to accomodate efficient local buffering.
 * - Files are buffered locally.
 *
 * USING FILE-LEVEL FUNCTIONS
 *
 * PHP provides a number of file-level functions that stream wrappers can
 * optionally support. Here are a few such functions:
 *
 * - file_exists()
 * - is_readable()
 * - stat()
 * - filesize()
 * - fileperms()
 *
 * The OpenStack stream wrapper provides support for these file-level functions.
 * But there are a few things you should know:
 *
 * - Each call to one of these functions generates at least one request. It may
 *   be as many as three:
 *   * An auth request
 *   * A request for the container (to get container permissions)
 *   * A request for the object
 * - IMPORTANT: Unlike the fopen()/fclose()... functions NONE of these functions
 *   retrieves the body of the file. If you are working with large files, using
 *   these functions may be orders of magnitude faster than using fopen(), etc.
 *   (The crucial detail: These kick off a HEAD request, will fopen() does a
 *   GET request).
 * - You must use Bootstrap::setConfiguration() to pass in all of the values you
 *   would normally pass into a stream context:
 *   * endpoint
 *   * username
 *   * password
 * - Most of the information from this family of calls can also be obtained using
 *   fstat(). If you were going to open a stream anyway, you might as well use
 *   fopen()/fstat().
 * - stat() and fstat() fake the permissions and ownership as follows:
 *   * uid/gid are always sset to the current user. This basically assumes that if
 *     the current user can access the object, the current user has ownership over
 *     the file. As the OpenStack ACL system developers, this may change.
 *   * Mode is faked. Swift uses ACLs, not UNIX mode strings. So we fake the string:
 *     - 770: The ACL has the object marked as private.
 *     - 775: The ACL has the object marked as public.
 *     - ACLs are actually set on the container, so every file in a public container
 *       will return 775.
 * - stat/fstat provide only one timestamp. Swift only tracks mtime, so mtime, atime,
 *   and ctime are all set to the last modified time.
 *
 * DIRECTORIES
 *
 * OpenStack Swift does not really have directories. Rather, it allows
 * characters such as '/' to be used to designate namespaces on object
 * names. (For simplicity, this library uses only '/' as a separator).
 *
 * This allows for simulated directory listings. Requesting
 * `scandir('swift://foo/bar/')` is really a request to "find all of the items
 * in the 'foo' container whose names start with 'bar/'".
 *
 * Because of this...
 *
 * - Directory reading functions like scandir(), opendir(), readdir()
 *   and so forth are supported.
 * - Functions to create or remove directories (mkdir() and rmdir()) are
 *   meaningless, and thus not supported.
 *
 * Swift still has support for "directory markers" (special zero-byte files
 * that act like directories). However, since there are no standards for how
 * said markers ought to be created, they are not supported by the stream
 * wrapper.
 *
 * As usual, the underlying \OpenStack\ObjectStore\v1\Resource\Container class
 * supports the full range of Swift features.
 *
 * SUPPORTED CONTEXT PARAMETERS
 *
 * This section details paramters that can be passed either
 * through a stream context or through
 * \OpenStack\Bootstrap\setConfiguration().
 *
 * PHP functions that do not allow you to pass a context may still be supported
 * here IF you have set options using Bootstrap::setConfiguration().
 *
 * You are required to pass in authentication information. This
 * comes in one of three forms:
 *
 * -# User login: username, password, tenantid, endpoint
 * -# Existing (valid) token: token, swift_endpoint
 *
 * As of 1.0.0-beta6, you may use `tenantname` instead of `tenantid`.
 *
 * The third method (token) can be used when the application has already
 * authenticated. In this case, a token has been generated and assigned
 * to an user and tenant.
 *
 * The following parameters may be set either in the stream context
 * or through OpenStack\Bootstrap::setConfiguration():
 *
 * - token: An auth token. If this is supplied, authentication is skipped and
 *     this token is used. NOTE: You MUST set swift_endpoint if using this
 *     option.
 * - swift_endpoint: The URL to the swift instance. This is only necessary if
 *     'token' is set. Otherwise it is ignored.
 * - username: A username. MUST be accompanied by 'password' and 'tenantid' (or 'tenantname').
 * - password: A password. MUST be accompanied by 'username' and 'tenantid' (or 'tenantname').
 * - endpoint: The URL to the authentication endpoint. Necessary if you are not
 *     using a 'token' and 'swift_endpoint'.
 * - content_type: This is effective only when writing files. It will
 *     set the Content-Type of the file during upload.
 * - tenantid: The tenant ID for the services you will use. (A user may
 *     have multiple tenancies associated.)
 * - tenantname: The tenant name for the services you will use. You may use
 *     this in lieu of tenant ID.
 *
 * @see http://us3.php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php
 *
 * @todo The service catalog should be cached in the context like the token so that
 * it can be retrieved later.
